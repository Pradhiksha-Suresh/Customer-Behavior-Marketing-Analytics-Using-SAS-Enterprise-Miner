This project involved an end-to-end business analytics study of a U.S. supermarket chain using SAS Enterprise Miner and the SEMMA methodology. Multiple datasets covering customer demographics, transaction data, branch-level spending, and advertisement click-through rates were analyzed to address declining revenues and improve decision-making. Key techniques included Market Basket Analysis for product bundling, Customer Segmentation using clustering, Decision Tree modeling to understand customer spending behavior, Linear Regression to identify profit drivers, and extensive Exploratory Data Analysis for pattern discovery. The analysis produced actionable insights for targeted marketing, inventory optimization, advertising budget allocation, and customer retention strategies, demonstrating how advanced analytics can drive operational efficiency and revenue growth.
